# Terraform AWS Cloud

This repository is about experimenting and practicing using Terraform, a powerful infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, to develop and automate an AWS infrastructure for a fictitious company.

## AWS Cloud Solution For 2 Company Websites Using A Reverse Proxy Technology

**WARNING**: This infrastructure setup is NOT covered by the AWS free tier. Therefore, ensure to DELETE ALL the resources created immediately after finishing the project. Monthly costs may be shockingly high if resources are not deleted. Also, it is strongly recommended to set up a budget and configure notifications when your spending reaches a predefined limit. Watch this video to learn how to configure the AWS budget.

The sole aim of this project is to build the infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.

We will build a secure infrastructure inside the AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company (Choose an interesting name for it) that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website for its DevOps team. As part of the company's desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

Cost, Security, and Scalability are the major requirements for this project. Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, ensures that infrastructure for both websites, WordPress and Tooling, is resilient to Web Server's failures, can accommodate increased traffic, and, at the same time, has a reasonable cost.

The tooling code is stored in this repository
